# 0000 — Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** (set on creation)

## Context

This project records significant architectural decisions as ADRs so the factory
(and humans) can see *why* the code is shaped the way it is, not just *what* it
does. Without this, decisions get re-litigated and the rationale is lost.

## Decision

Use Architecture Decision Records. One file per decision in `docs/adr/`, numbered
sequentially (`NNNN-slug.md`). A decision is "structural" when it changes a
boundary, a dependency, a data model, or a cross-cutting convention.

Each ADR has: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives considered.

The `developer` writes an ADR when implementing a structural change; the
`documentator` backfills any that were missed.

## Consequences

- Structural changes carry their reasoning with them.
- Reviewers can check a change against its stated decision.

## Alternatives considered

- **No ADRs** — rejected: rationale evaporates, decisions get re-debated.
- **One big DECISIONS.md** — rejected: merge conflicts, no per-decision status.

---

> Copy this file to `NNNN-<slug>.md` for each new decision. Keep ADRs short and
> immutable — supersede with a new ADR rather than editing an accepted one.
