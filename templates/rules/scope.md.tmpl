# Scope & worktree discipline

## Worktree isolation

- Each ticket is implemented in its own git worktree under `worktrees/<branch>/`.
- A developer edits **only** inside its worktree. Never edit the base checkout
  while a worktree is open.
- Bash is stateless between calls — every command `cd`s into the worktree first.
- The `merger` is the only agent that merges worktree branches back.

## Change scope

- Change only what the ticket requires. No drive-by refactors, no reformatting
  unrelated files. Out-of-scope improvements go to a new ticket.
- Don't touch generated files, lockfiles, or vendored code unless the ticket is
  about them.

## Off-limits without explicit human approval

- Force-push, history rewrite, branch deletion.
- Production deploys, data migrations against real data, destructive commands.
- Changing auth, billing, or secret-handling code (always reviewed by a human).
